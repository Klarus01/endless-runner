# endless-runner
Play as a minotaur stuck in a maze in this 3D Unity game. Run endlessly, trying to escape the maze. When you bonk your head on stones too many times, you'll end up in a store where you can make upgrades and get new skin colors.

When the player hits his head on a stone, he is thrown backwards and slowed down and the stone itself is destroyed.
